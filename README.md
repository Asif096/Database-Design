In this project, you need to design a database system for a given domain. For this, first you need to conduct research about the domain itself and collect data requirements (such as information about the main components of the system, how the system works, how different entities interact with each other etc.) Then you will try to design a system as practical as possible. This means, assumptions you make should comply well with real-world situations/scenarios.
